Hello to all employers, my name is Luis Solorzano. I am currently interning at UL Solutions under the Global Analytics team as well as work with their
Automation team. The focus of my work there is to create cash forecasts using Python algorithms as well as automating various processes to save time 
and money. In my 5 months of being an intern I have helped with major projects such as web scraping flights to check for that the whole company uses, as well 
as helping to convert all of the code written in C# to Python. 


During my internship at Ul Solutions I have been assigned to many automating tasks. Through Python, Power Automate and Blue Prism I have been 
able to automate a great many processes. Along with automating I was also tasked to create dashboards in Power BI, and I extensively used Excel. 
These are the languages I am most comfortable in, however, I am also profficient in Java, C++, SQL, HTML, and JavaScript.


For a more detailed view of my work experience here is a link to my resume.
Within the resume I have my contact information if you have further questions, feel free to contact me.
